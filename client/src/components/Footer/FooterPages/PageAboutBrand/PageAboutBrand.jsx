            As a child, your worries had laid entirely in daylight. There were
            no routine problems, and no commitment to follow and not delegated.
            Even being an adult, you often remember your childhood, when the
            guys in the park, laughing cheerfully, drive past you on their
            bikes. Your first dream came true when you woke up on your tenth
            birthday to find a brand new bike. It seems that earlier dreams were
            more accessible, literally at arms length.

            You grew up, became an adult, and independent, but heres the paradox
            - for some reason dreams have become difficult to achieve. You freed
            yourself from custody, but problems and troubles came in exchange.
            Life has become like an endless race with no finish line. This is
            the case when you gain not from participation but from liberation.
            Why would we regain the feeling of freedom that was once lost in
            childhood?

                Here at Pridebikes, we are committed to enjoying life. And by
                creating bicycles, we share this opportunity with others. And
                for reaching this zen, it is just enough to forget about the
                routine for a while and allow yourself to be childish â€” sit on a
                bicycle, put your head on airing and you will feel how the
                problems fading away with every kilometer, and you see only a
                roadbed in front of you. Even such a short-term escape from
                reality will make you happier and give you the feeling of
                flying.

                Returning home from a bike ride, you inevitably come back

                return the pleasure forgotten from your childhood from simple
                things, will make you feel alive.

                Pride has always been and will remain a brand for pleasure. We

                cycling. After all, each of us deserves our own personal time
                and an escape from reality, at least short, but which inevitably
                brings inspiration and thirst for new trips.
